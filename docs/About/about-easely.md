# Easely

### The NFT Creator Paradox

The paradox in the world of NFTs is that NFTs are an artistic medium perfect for creators (often non-technical) but are inherently technical as NFTs are defined by blockchain code in the form of smart contracts. As a result, most creators do not have access to the full range of NFT technology due to their lack of technical abilities or access to developer resources. **As the world stands today, Web3 creators are restricted by how much blockchain code they know.**

### Easely's Mission

Easely has a mission to empower anyone to create on Web3 with no code. **We are building a world where creators are not restricted by how much blockchain code they know, but by their imagination.** Easely focuses on no-coding all blockchain components - creating NFTs, selling NFTs, claiming NFTs, etc. As we lower the tech barrier for developing NFT experiences, creators can fully extend their imaginations and further push the boundaries of what is possible. This flywheel will result in more innovative NFT features, more engaging NFT experiences, and ultimately more people interacting with Web3 and the metaverse!

### Why Easely?

* **Your contracts, no-code, zero overhead:** Creators can use Easely to create their own contracts completely by themselves with no-code (zero programming knowledge required). There is no application process or minimum twitter follower requirement - all creators deserve equal access to create in Web3. 
* **Horizontal feature development:** Easely is the first no-code smart contract platform with flexible and end-to-end features such as randomized packes, burn mechanics, lazy minting, and mint buttons. This isn't just a minting platform to create a single NFT. Easely is committed to enabling all creators with access to the most popular NFT features
* **Quality and trust:** Many people compare building in Web3 to building a rocketship - a single loose screw in a smart contract and the whole thing can be worthless. The process requires high volumes of testing, iteration, and frankly mistakes, to nail down. Easely does the hard work for you so we can provide all creators with industry-grade smart contracts optimized for price, ownership, and efficiency.

### Roadmap

Easely's feature plans fall broadly in the following categories: 
* **Apps and extensions:** Easely will continue no-coding apps and extensions that are custom built today. For example airdrops, staking, and fractionalization are becoming more common in NFT experiences but only add more complexities for non-technical creators.
* **Multi-chain support:** Easely believes in a multi-chain future and will build functionality for a variety of blockchains to satisfy different use cases. Though there are no exact plans on what blockchain is next, Easely is proritizing a low/no-gas solution.
* **Secondary capabilities:** Although prominent secondary marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible exist today, there is appetite for creators to build their own private secondary marketplaces (e.g. see LarvaLabs) to further personalize their NFT experiences. Easely will explore offering no-code tools to stand up private secondary marketplaces.

Most importantly, our roadmap depends on you - the creators. The Easely team is closely listening to the community when building what's next and solving for the greatest painpoints that non-technical creators face today.
