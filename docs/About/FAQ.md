### Why are you called Easely? 

Because nothing about the blockchain and NFTs is easy today and we are going to change that, no-coding one feature at a time. Our platform also supports your creations like an easel does an artist's paintigs :)  

### Who are you? 

We're a team of ex-Web2 builders (AirBnB, Carta, Pinterest, Stripe, Uber, etc.) that have been NFT fanatics since we graduated early and were building ERC-721 apps in 2018. When we saw the world beginning to adopt NFTs but the development infrastructure had not changed, we knew millions of creators were being gatekept from building in Web3. We immediately quit our Web2 jobs to build this bridge and provide creators access to the beautiful technology that is NFTs.
