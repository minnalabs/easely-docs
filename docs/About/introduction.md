# Introduction

If you want to get started right off the bat, feel free to check out our video tutorials for [standard](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7ES5dIQALn5F7IISBZ6fVCkwnfC_URqe) and [randomized](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7ES5dIQALn5tPg0i7AwtIYcxFhq6cnkz) collections. 

### What is Easely? 

Easely is a no-code platform for NFT development currently on Ethereum. We create a suite of tools, apps, smart contracts, and more to allow creators with no coding knowledge create complex NFT experiences. Currently, Easely has the following products and features live:
* **Standard Collections:** standard custom contract for creators to mint or sell individual NFTs
* **Randomized Collections:** custom contract for randomized packs often used for generative PFP or avatar projects 
* **Burn/Redemption Mechanics:** ability for NFT owners to burn (delete) their NFTs to claim or forge physical items
* **Mint Buttons:** tools for creators to sell the NFTs created on Easely's platform natively on their own websites

### What is an NFT? 

NFTs stand for `non-fungible tokens`. It's a big word that simply means no two tokens on a blockchain are the same, ever. Every token is verifiably unique with proof of ownership. Tokens are simply units of data often representing (but not limited to) media files in the form of digital images, sounds, videos, etc. 

### What is Ethereum? 

All NFTs exist on a blockchain. Ethereum is the most popular blockchain for development and the most popular blockchain for NFTs today. There are plenty of other blockchains like Solana and Flow and layer 2 Ethereum networks like Polygon and Immutable X. The gold standard today for NFTs is Ethereum, specifically the ERC-721 protocol. 

A big thing to note is that blockchain interoperability is not great today. Many dapps such as marketplaces are built for a single blockchain (e.g. OpenSea for Ethereum) and cannot support other blockchain NFTs. Thus, creators should be thoughtful on the varying factors associated with each blockchain when thinking about where to create their NFTs. 

### Why NFTs? Isn't it just an image/JPEG? 

It is true that often the underlying data for NFTs are images. But, for the first time ever, there is now a **public, easily accessible record of who created the JPEG, who owns the JPEG, and which is the original JPEG**. These simple but powerful characteristics now attribute value to digital content. 

Many would argue that JPEGs, for the longest time, have simply been undervalued. A meme that's been viewed hundreds of millions of times or a music video that broke the internet - just because they are readily available on the internet doesn't mean their fundamental value as original, creative, historical pieces is worthless. 

NFTs are letting the people be the invisible hand in placing value on digital content that goes straight back to the creator. The technology inherently solves for expensive services in the fine art world - authentication, transaction, security - making NFTs a far more accessible (and useful!) as a medium. Even better, art and collectibles have just been the gateway. NFTs today have found success as membership tokens, fractional ownership, gaming assets, with an infinite number of possibilities that you, as a creator, have an opportunity to define.
