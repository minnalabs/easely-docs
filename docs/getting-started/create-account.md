# Creating an Account

### Your Wallet is Your Identity

In the web3 world, digital wallets store cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, and more. Your wallet is your identity, which is especially true as a creator because your wallet will always be the source (the provenance) for the NFTs that you create and is publicly viewable to anyone. 

Thus, your wallet is also the basis of your Easely account. This way all smart contracts/collections and NFTs you create on Easely will tie back to you. In today's world, it is very common for wallets to act as the SSO (single sign-on) for blockchain apps because they are secure and interoperable. Easely specifically works with MetaMask, the most popular Ethereum wallet. If you don't have one, it takes about a minute to download and create one [here](https://metamask.io/). 

### Signing Up

Sign up is as easy as connecting your MetaMask wallet, claiming your creator name, and verifying your email.

### Logging In

Once your account is created, you will always log in by connecting your wallet to Easely that is associated with your account. No passwords necessary. It goes without saying but keeping your MetaMask secure is of the utmost importance (don't lose or leak our key words)!
