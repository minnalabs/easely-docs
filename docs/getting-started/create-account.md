Welcome to Easely - please start by creating account on our MainNet (coming soon) and our [TestNet](https://app.rinkeby.easely.io/).

### TestNet vs. MainNet

Because most blockchains incur nontrivial transaction fees, test blockchains ("TestNet") were created for free development purposes. Most NFT creators utilize these TestNets when creating their NFTs, often with test wallets to mask their developmental work from the world. 

On Ethereum, the primary network is denoted "MainNet" with many test blockchains (Rinkeby, Ropsten, Kovan, etc.) as "TestNets". Easely offers a TestNet version of the platform on `Rinkeby`. It is highly recommended to test on `Rinkeby` first prior to any deployment / execution of contracts on MainNet. You can request for Rinkeby TestNet ETH [here](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) or contact the Easely team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/VsJuceBV) and we will gladly send some over!

### Your Wallet is Your Identity

In the web3 world, digital wallets store cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, and more. Your wallet is your identity, which is especially true as a creator because your wallet will always be the source (the provenance) for the NFTs that you create and is publicly viewable to anyone. 

Thus, your wallet is also the basis of your Easely account. This way all smart contracts/collections and NFTs you create on Easely will tie back to you. In today's world, it is very common for wallets to act as the SSO (single sign-on) for blockchain apps because they are secure and interoperable. Easely specifically works with MetaMask, the most popular Ethereum wallet. If you don't have one, it takes about a minute to download and create one [here](https://metamask.io/). 

### Signing Up

Sign up is as easy as connecting your MetaMask wallet, claiming your creator name, and verifying your email. 

### Logging In

Once your account is created, you will always log in by connecting your wallet to Easely that is associated with your account. No passwords necessary. It goes without saying but keeping your MetaMask secure is of the utmost importance (don't lose or leak our key words)!
