# Burn Mechanic

"Burning" an NFT means functionally deleting the NFT from the blockchain - no one else can ever own that NFT. This is a very powerful mechanic that creators are integrating into their NFT experiences. Burning is used as deflationary mechanisms, redemption mechanisms, creative mediums, and so much more. The NFT community is just beginning to explore burning with some famouse use cases: 
* [Uniswap's UNISOCKS](https://defiprime.com/unisocks-explained) were burned to receive the physical pair of unisocks + an NFT 
* [Glenfiddich sold ultra-rare whiskey bottles](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2021/10/27/glenfiddich-sells-18000-super-rare-whisky-as-nfts--heres-what-that-means/) at $15K a piece as NFTs that were burned to claim the physical bottle
* [PUNKS Comic](https://medium.com/@deconomist/punks-comic-to-stake-or-burn-55ed61446e15) had a "burn vs. stake mechanism" 
* [Pak created a system](https://twitter.com/muratpak/status/1381704129630904322) where burning his NFTs resulting in an ERC-20 cryptocurrency, $ASH

All NFTs on Easely's platform can be set as burnable. Even better, Easely can even issue a NEW NFT once the original NFT is burned (this can be set when you create the NFT under "Issue NFT Upon Burn"). Another crucial feature Easely provides is verifying the burn and **securely collecting information from the NFT owner, e.g. shipping information** to facilitate your experience. We love seeing our creators like [Saysh](https://saysh.com/pages/nft) and [StreetArt](https://streetartnft.xyz/collection) incorporate burn mechanics in their NFT experiences - what will you create?  

Note: the act of "burning" does require gas aka transaction fees for the owner. This should be taken into account when designing your NFTs.
