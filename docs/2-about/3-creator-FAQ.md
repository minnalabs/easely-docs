# Creator FAQs

### How do I apply to use Easely as a creator? 

There is no application. Anyone can use Easely, just go to our website. Our mission is to make NFT development a free and widely accessible tech that anyone can use

### How much does Easely cost?

There are no upfront fees to use Easely - the only fee creators pay upfront is the contract/collection deployment fee (gas) to the blockchain network. This ranges ~0.05 E depending on gas prices. 

Easely takes a 5% fee from mint sales so we are directly aligned with our creators

### Does Easely offer additional support for bigger or custom projects (e.g. additional features not in the platform today)? 

You can apply for Easelyâ€™s Studio program in which a member of the team will work closer with you on a project and any bespoke features. DM @edamame in our Discord or email studio@easely.io for now as we put together a formal process

### Will Easely help market my project? Web development? Act as a dev on the team? 

We may repost you on our socials but we do not offer or guarantee any marketing services. We also will not do web development or act as a dev on your team unless you are part of the Studio program, in which it will be on a case-by-case basis. Easely is the tech layer that covers all your needs that touch the blockchain as a creator - nothing more, nothing less

### Will Easely offer tech support for my project? Especially on minting day? 

We will offer support for any customer that has trouble minting (please send them to our Discord) and will pay additional attention on mint day. Please communicate with us in advance when launch dates are
