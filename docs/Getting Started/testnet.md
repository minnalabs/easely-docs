# TestNet vs. MainNet

Because most blockchains incur nontrivial transaction fees, test blockchains ("TestNet") were created for free development purposes. Most NFT creators utilize these TestNets when creating their NFTs, often with test wallets to mask their developmental work from the world. 

On Ethereum, the primary network is denoted "MainNet" with many test blockchains (Rinkeby, Ropsten, Kovan, etc.) as "TestNets". Easely offers a TestNet version of the platform on Rinkeby. It is highly recommended to test on Rinkeby first prior to any deployment / execution of contracts on MainNet. You can request for Rinkeby TestNet ETH [here](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) or contact the Easely on [Discord](https://discord.gg/VsJuceBV) (who will gladly send some over!) 

Below we will walkthrough creating a Standard Collection on TestNet.
