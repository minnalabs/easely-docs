**NOTE: If you have any questions or would like an onboarding call, hop into our [Discord](https://discord.gg/YpA4JumgC2) and reach out to anyone on the Easely team.**

### Step 1: Create a listing
You will need to first [create a listing](/getting-started/create-account) before following this guide.

This integration will work with listings created either on [testnet](https://app.rinkeby.easely.io) or [mainnet](https://app.easely.io).

### Step 2: Login
Start off in the builder view for your [Muse](https://muse.place) world. Press Tab to open the menu.

### Step 3: Add NFT Media
Using the "Media" component, add the media for your NFT.

### Step 4: Add buy button
Once you have your image in place, we can add the buy button. To do so, click "Add" on the build menu.

Click "Specify" and paste in the following ID to add the buy button.
```text

```

### Step 5: Configure
Once you hit "Add", you should see a blank button pop up. Click on it to configure the settings.

![set parameters](/img/muse/set_parameters.png)

In the top box, paste in your listing ID. You can navigate to it from the [Collections](https://app.easely.io/collections) page.
It should look like `lst_...`.

In the second box, you can customize the text that's shown on the button.

The last box may be used to set the border and font color.

### Step 6: Publish
Once you're happy with the way it all looks, click "Publish" to save the changes to your world.

### Step 7: Try it out
Visitors to your world will now be able to view and mint your NFT without leaving your world. 
If you're using a testnet listing, you can grab some ETH from the [faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby) and give it a go.
